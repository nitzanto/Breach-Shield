  <h3 align="center"><a>Overview</a></h3>

  <p align="center">
    The Password Checker checks if a password has been leaked in previous data breaches using the Pwned Passwords API. It takes a list of passwords as command line arguments and checks each password against the API to see if it has been leaked. If a password has been leaked, it displays a message indicating how many times it has been leaked and suggests that the user change the password. If a password hasn't been leaked, then it'll displays a message indicating that it is safe.

  <h2 align="center"><a>Why do I need this?</a></h2>
    <p align="center">
        Hackers use methods such as dictionary & brute force attacks to access into emails and accounts that their passwords has been leaked.
    Therefore you can run this program to check if your password has been compromised.
